def calculate_score(flags: list[FraudFlag]) -> tuple[int, str]:
    """Combine fraud flags into a 0–100 risk score and a risk level string.

    Algorithm:
    1. Compute an individual score for each flag:
           base_score * (confidence / 100)
       where base_score is looked up by (flag_type, severity).
    2. Sort individual scores descending.
    3. Sum with diminishing returns: each successive flag contributes half
       the weight of the previous one. This prevents trivial multi-flag
       receipts from always pinning at 100, while still pushing the score
       meaningfully higher when multiple serious signals coincide.
    4. Clamp to [0, 100] and round to the nearest integer.

    Examples:
        one duplicate (high, conf=100) → 75 → "high"
        one policy violation (medium, conf=85) → 25 → "low"
        duplicate (high) + policy violation (medium) → 75 + 15 = 90 → "high"
        three low policy violations → 15 + 7 + 3 = 25 → "low"

    Returns:
        (fraud_score, risk_level) — e.g. (75, "high")
